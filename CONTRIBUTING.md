### Before we begin

We wish to set certain expectations:

- We take on small tasks, iterate on those, and ship it.

- We work with deadlines. Deadlines are important; without which nothing would ever get shipped to real end users.

  If you're not comfortable with a deadline, communicate and call it out immediately. It's better to inform the team earlier than later. Helps us plan better.

  We are here to help you take a task over the line. And help is always given to those who ask for it.

- This is voluntary, we cannot remunerate you. We would do our best to give you a shout out wherever possible; but engaging in this does not entitle you to any monetary compensation.

- You do NOT have copyright over content you contribute or create. Once your content gets reviewed and merged to main repository; it belongs to r/IndiaInvestments.

### How to Add a Note?

- [Create a note on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/new)

  You can use [markdown syntax](https://hackmd.io/c/codimd-documentation/%2F%40codimd%2Fmarkdown-syntax)

- Reach out to moderators or someone with the `Doc` role in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/hqBNg4u).

  We can create a PR from this note. We'll mention you in the PR :100:

  Alternatively, if you know how to use GitHub, [fork the repository](https://github.com/indiainvestments/indiainvestments.github.io) under your GitHub username. Then from your HackMD note, sync with your GitHub fork.

  Note that, **you won't be able to sync with our GitHub repo directly from HackMD**, due to our privacy setting.

  [This tutorial](https://hackmd.io/c/tutorials/%2Fs%2Flink-with-github) has detailed instructions, if you get stuck or need help. Once done, you'd be able to raise a PR from the fork.

  If you're not on a phone, you could just copy the content of your HackMD note, in a local editor / IDE (VSCode, Atom, Sublime Text, WebStorm, IntelliJ, PyCharm etc.); then raise PR following good old-fashioned git workflow.

### What about code? I thought there'd be bots

Yes, we do need volunteers and contributors who can build & configure Discord bots. Other than that, we've plans for improving on our website, and add more functionalities.

It's not mandatory, but if you have basic JS / TS knowledge, that'd help.

You could take a look at [open tasks in roadmap](https://github.com/indiainvestments/roadmap/issues), come up with ideas, implement those and share with us.

Though we'd prefer you discuss with us, before you implement even a single function / method / class. There might be others who're working on something similar, and it could end up being duplicated effort.

**If you raise a pull request with code. without discussing with anyone from the team, expect it to remain stale, or be outright rejected by core team**.

Most importantly, we need people who have literature, or general non-tech background. Or have actually worked in finance industry. Our wiki is diverse, and people with diverse backgrounds are best suited for building this.

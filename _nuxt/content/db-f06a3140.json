Is it possible?\n- Whether one can consistently beat the market - and what it takes\n\n# Beating the market — what it means\n\nThe phrase _beating the market_ can mean different things for different people. The intuitive definition is to earn returns on a portfolio level that consistently beats the market index. However, more people allocate their equity investments in funds managed actively than passively - so it makes sense to see how your returns stack up against that of professional investors (simply put, those who invest money on behalf of others), or at-least try to understand how an individual investor has a fighting chance against institutions in the chase for every possible rupee gain.\n\n## Beating the index\n\nIt's easy to achieve average market performance, one simply needs to _buy the market_ through a low cost index or exchange trading fund - and there's nothing wrong with aiming to get what is known as market returns; between February 2000 to 2020, over a 20 year period, Nifty Total Return Index [^1] returned a compounded annualized growth rate of 14.3% per year, comfortably beating inflation.\n\nIf **efficient market hypothesis** is to be believed, stock prices reflect consensus view of all publicly available information that can have a material impact on the price action of the stock. However, that doesn't render the exercise of finding mismatches between price and intrinsic value of a stock ineffectual. Instead, it involves finding instances where the consensus view of the market is itself inaccurate, thus creating an opportunity to make money from the divergence.\n\nSo, if an analytical mind is willing to invest time and effort in pursuit of such mismatches, earning profits higher than the market returns is possible, and can be a great tool to create wealth for goals.\n\n## Beating professional investors\n\nThere are several logical, financial and regulatory obstructions that a professional investor has to face, which makes the prospects of individual investors beating them higher. Some are,\n\n- The account size of professional investors is such that any meaningful investment in a midcap or smallcap stock has an impact on its price. And so, they're constrained with a limited universe of companies to pick from.\n- Professional investors are bound by the mandate of the fund they manage, and so any investment that falls outside of this mandate is out of the question, further constraining the universe of companies to invest in.\n- Like an individual investors, the performance of a professional investor is compared to market returns. However, unlike an individual investor, a professional investor can't pragmatically afford to underperform the market for a long duration at the risk of losing their clients. To a professional investor, this is known as _benchmark risk,_ and the only way to keep up for them is to imitate an index once a reasonable alpha is generated. Once this happens, the professional investor generally tends to stop caring about additional returns, and rather focuses on averting losses that could cost them their jobs.\n- Most professional investors lean towards having a diversified portfolio as a consequence of avoiding these risks, and thus outperforming the market with such diversification is relatively improbable compared to a curated portfolio maintained by an individual investor.\n\n### Is beating the market the only goal in stock picking?\n\nIt is worth noting that the exercise of comparing an individual investor's returns against that of the market, and that of professional investors is relative in nature. However, picking stocks should encompass more than that. Critics would be correct to note that majority of individual investors beating the market luck out on taking incremental risks that they don't necessarily know or acknowledge. As Seth Klerman notes in his annotation in Howard Marks' _The Most Important Thing —_\n\n> \"Beating the market matters, but limiting risk matters just as much. Ultimately, investors have to ask themselves whether they are interested in relative or absolute returns. Losing 45 percent while the market drops 50 percent qualifies as market outperformance, but what a pyrrhic victory this would be for most of us.\"\n\nAn argument can be made that another upside to the exercise of stock picking is that if it is done correctly, the comprehension of risks associated with the equity you hold is higher than when investing in a fund — active or passive. The reason is simple: it takes less time and effort to keep track of stocks in the individual investor's concentrated portfolio than stocks in a diversified equity fund.\n\n# Can you beat the market?\n\nEstablishing the possibility of beating the market is futile if one doesn't acknowledge what it takes to do it consistently — a brutal cocktail of time, effort, discipline, conviction, contrarianism, and an investment philosophy to invest the time, effort, discipline, and conviction in.\n\n## Sticking to an investment philosophy\n\nAn investment philosophy can be thought of as a construct of mental models upon which the investor builds his portfolio upon. If the universe of stocks under the investor's circle of competence is chaos - an unexplored territory of potential, the investor mines out order from this chaos in the form of a portfolio, using mental models as forklifts. The lack of having an investment philosophy generally results in owning stocks that are not a perfect fit for the portfolio. As Chuck Palahniuk writes in his book,\n\n> 'If you don't know what you want, you end up with a lot you don't.'\n\nSo, mental models help investors validate their strategy by providing a confined framework, and an investment philosophy is a set of mental models that the investor follows. Luckily, mental models in stock picking have been figured out to a large extent (such as momentum, growth, low multiples and value investing), one simply needs to recognize, study, and implement them.\n\n## Second level thinking — having an _'edge'_\n\nFor all intents and purposes, every investor (professional and individual) competes in pursuit of profits in any asset working with the same information available in the public forum. The consensus on the impact of this information is what establishes the stock price in the short run, and so if your view aligns with that of the majority, it makes sense that you'll largely make market returns - every investor can't beat the market as together they are the market. To get extraordinary returns, you need to have an extraordinary perspective. This is what Howard Marks calls _second level thinking_, Ben Graham calls _trace of wisdom_, and Warren Buffett & Charlie Munger call _having an edge._\n\nThis is not to say the consensus view of information is always wrong, in all likeliness millions of other investors may be smarter and more knowledgeable than you. The idea is to find instances where the individual investor can use contrarian insight that the market isn't reflecting, and it has to be accurate, or at-least _more correct_ than the consensus view.\n\nTo quote Howard Marks' _The Most Important Thing,_\n\n> Only if your behavior is unconventional is your performance likely to be unconventional, and only if your judgments are superior is your performance likely to be above average. For your performance to diverge from the norm, your expectations— and thus your portfolio—have to diverge from the norm, and you have to be more right than the consensus. Different and better: that’s a pretty good description of second-level thinking.\n\nMarks also proceeds to provide a framework, a set of questions that an investor must ask when working with contrarian thinking,\n\n- What is the range of likely future outcomes?\n- Which outcome do I think will occur?\n- What’s the probability I’m right?\n- What does the consensus think?\n- How does my expectation differ from the consensus?\n- How does the current price for the asset comport with the consensus view of the future, and with mine?\n- Is the consensus psychology that’s incorporated in the price too bullish or bearish?\n- What will happen to the asset’s price if the consensus turns out to be right, and what if I’m right?\n\nTo sum it up, holding consensus view on any material information comes naturally to us — specially if an investor relies on financial news channels or social media to acquire information; but that's not how above average returns can be achieved, by definition consensus views largely yields market return. The ability to accurately spot market inefficiencies requires _an edge._\n\n## Reading it all\n\nTaking the time and effort to read annual reports, brokerage reports, primers, conference call transcripts, and various other filings are all part of what an investors signs up for while performing due diligence for a company. Skim, and you may miss what disproves your investment thesis, which is perhaps one of the major reasons for higher churn rates in an individual investor's portfolio.\n\nWhen asked on how to make smart investments, Warren Buffett said,\n\n> “Read 500 pages like this every week. That’s how knowledge builds up, like compound interest.”\n\nTo beat the market, you need to bring what's needed to be a succesful investor, and that means sacrificing a lot of time and effort that could have been used elsewhere, like your day job. **At some point, an investor needs to decide whether the cost of time and effort exceeds the benefit of outperformance in his/her stock picking journey.**\n\n## Conviction and patience is everything\n\nHaving an accurate non-consensus view will only get you as far as your conviction on the investment thesis goes. Remember, the market can stay irrational for long durations of time. As Sanjay Bakshi notes in his appareance in an episode of the We Study Billionaires podcast, unlike many other professions, an investor rarely receives an immediate feedback on his operations. Sometimes it takes years for the market to catch up to intrinsic value of an asset, and so it is hard to separate luck from genuine success — so hold on to the underlying process rather than focusing on the outcome. A good handle on your conviction helps you to hang in until other investors catch up on the market's inefficiencies. On this subject, Joel Greenblatt annotates on _The Most Important Thing,_\n\n> I always tell my students, “If you do a good job valuing a stock, I guarantee that the market will agree with you.” I just don’t tell them when. It could be weeks or years.\n\nAnother thing to note is an investor should never rely on borrowed conviction, primarily because it's never enough to hold on to. If you don't do your own research, and rather rely on someone else's, the conviction tends to be weak, and so emotions act up, and exit plans are broken before the thesis fully appreciates. The other reason is that you have to rely on the goodwill of the researcher, as they may not warn you if something disproves their thesis.\n\n### Investing can't be perfectly routinized\n\nAs Howard Marks notes in _The Most Important Thing,_ investing is more art than science — in the sense that past results can't be relied upon with confidence, the cause and effect relationships can't be depended upon. And so, investing can't be routinized. An investor must be able to adapt to changes in the market dynamics to consistently outperform the market.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nTo sum it up, an individual investor needs to invest time and effort, have a capability to think on a higher level than the consensus view, adapt to changes in market dynamics, and have the capacity for patience and conviction to consistently beat the market.\n\n[^1]: In India, we don't have any index fund/ETF which gives exposure to the total stock markets.

No TDS applies on them.\n\nThe overall income is taxable as income from other sources.\n\nThe overall loss can be claimed as business loss.\n\n\\_Eg. if a member receives Rs. 22,000 instead of Rs. 20,000, then Rs. 2,000 would be taxable as Income from other sources.\n\n\\_While if a member receives Rs. 18,000 instead of Rs. 20,000, then the difference of Rs. 2,000 can be claimed as a business loss.\n\n### Benefits of Chit Funds\n\nThose members who are in need of money (for small business, marriage, construction of house, big expense, etc ) can bid for the Pot in the initial months and use that money for their own purposes.

Consider your own risk appetite and financial situation before putting money in a chit fund. If you still want to take such a risk, at least go by organized reputed chit fund groups, and not local unorganized ones.\n\n#### Red Flags\n\n1. Promise of high returns: Chit funds cannot promise return rates in advance, and if any of them does it, it is better to run away. They cannot do so because no one can predict at what discount would the members bid for the prize money during the entire duration of the chit fund.\n2. Unregistered: Please don't. You will have no recourse to get any money if there is any default.\n3. Incentive to get new members: If the chit fund offers any incentive to get new/additional members, then it is outside the normal rules of the chit fund and is likely to be a Ponzi scheme. Run.\n4. Allows to stop future installments after getting the prize money. This structure is also against the basic chit fund system, and should make you think of what else? Run.\n5.

However, this abnormal interest rate isn't gonna last forever. Until 31st Jan 2021, they were offering 7% interest in their savings account. IDFC First is improving their CASA ratio from retail deposits. Once they achieve their targets, they'll likely slash their interest rates further. For more details, check out [page 42 of the Q3 FY21 investor presentation](https://www.idfcfirstbank.com/content/dam/IDFCFirstBank/invester-relation/Financial-Results/2020/IDFC-FIRST-Bank-Investor-Presentation-Q3-FY21-new.pdf) from IDFC First Bank.\n\nAs a thumb rule, avoid co-operative banks and small finance banks. Although DICGC insures your deposits in a bank account up to ₹5 lakh, it's better not to rely on it and take unnecessary risks.\n\nCheck out below links if you want to know how to evaluate the health and safety of banks in India.\n\n- [How to see if a bank is risky for placing your deposits? [A guide from a banker]](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130165611/https://old.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/jwesme/how_to_see_if_a_bank_is_risky_for_placing_your/)\n- [Indian [private] Banks - Health scorecard](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130165616/https://old.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/k0q2pb/indian_private_banks_health_scorecard/)\n\nYou can get a deduction of ₹10,000 on earnings generated from interest in savings bank accounts under Section 80TTA. Senior citizens get a deduction of ₹50,000 under Section 80TTB and this includes interest earned from savings bank accounts as well as bank fixed deposits.\n\nThe second natural choice for most people should be **bank fixed deposits** which have reasonable liquidity and safety for parking money. As of January 2021, most big banks are offering anywhere between 4.9% to 5.5% interest rates on FDs. However, unlike bank accounts which are tax-exempt if the interest amount is less than ₹10,000, all interest income from a fixed deposit is taxable. The bank will auto deduct TDS @ 10% if your interest income from FDs exceed ₹40,000. You’ll have to pay any additional taxes later if you fall under income tax slabs higher than 10%.\n\nYou can also park your money in certain debt mutual funds. This includes **overnight funds** and **liquid funds** for parking money for a few months and **money market funds** for a few years. However, note that unlike savings account and fixed deposits, debt mutual funds are _marked to market_ which means that you should expect some volatility in day to day NAV. This volatility is mostly negligible in overnight and liquid funds but we have seen events like the Covid 19 crash in March 2020 when even liquid funds experienced a few days of relatively high volatility.\n\nHere are the NAV graphs of HDFC Liquid fund, the biggest liquid fund in India in terms of AUM, and Parag Parikh Liquid fund during the covid crisis.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/T9OktS0.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/G6ey8hB.png)\n\nThat being said, investments in debt funds don’t incur TDS or taxes until you redeem money from them. Many liquid funds also offer instant redemption up to ₹50,000 at any time of the day although the reliability of the instant redemption depends on the AMC website.\n\nAs an example, ₹1 lakh kept for 1 year in IDFC First savings bank account at 6% interest would give you ₹6,000. If you keep it in a savings bank account in big banks like SBI, HDFC, and ICICI, you'll get anywhere from ₹2,700 to ₹3,500. This interest income would be tax-free (since it's less than ₹10,000). A bank fixed deposit might give you anywhere from ₹4,991 to ₹5,875 and you'd have to pay taxes on it. Assuming a CAGR of 3%, a liquid fund would give you approximately ₹3,000 which is taxable but only when you redeem it.\n\nLast, but not least, there are **arbitrage funds**. These debt MFs are taxed like equity MFs so you don’t have to pay any taxes if you park your money for more than a year and your gains during redemption don’t exceed ₹1 lakh. This might sound good on paper but arbitrage funds are significantly more volatile than liquid funds and don’t offer instant redemptions either. The returns from arbitrage funds also depend on the availability of arbitrage opportunities and this has started to come into question. For more details, check out this [article](https://web.archive.org/web/20201130085545/https://www.capitalmind.in/2020/06/arbitrage-funds-you-dont-want-to-be-the-elephant-in-the-room/).\n\nAt the end of the day, when it comes to parking money in arbitrage funds, buyer beware.\n\nNow that we've covered where you can park your money, we'll list some instruments **where you probably shouldn't park money** for planned redemption in the near future.\n\n- Any debt mutual fund with somewhat significant interest rate or credit risk. This includes credit risk funds, dynamic bond funds, gilt funds, banking & PSU funds, ultra short, short, low, medium, and long duration funds, and corporate debt funds.\n- Hybrid mutual funds\n- Index funds like UTI Nifty index fund\n- Any other sort of equity mutual fund\n- Stocks\n","dir":"/en/faqs","path":"/en/faqs/park-money","extension":".md","createdAt":"2021-04-02T06:19:29.559Z","updatedAt":"2021-04-02T06:19:29.559Z","to":"/faqs/park-money","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1617344435125},"$loki":15},{"slug":"stocks-fundamentals-channel","description":"This is done to cull low-effort speculative queries on stocks.

They are broadly classified into two main categories based on the duration.\n\n* **Short Term Bonds** - Colloquially known as Treasury Bills (T Bills), these are secrurities that are issued for durations shorter than a year. Generally, only the central government issues this type of securities.\n* **Long Term Bonds** - These are dated securities which are sometimes referred to as GSecs (despite only being a subset of government securities). There are issued by both the central government as well as the state governments. When issued by the latter they are reffered to as State Development Loans (SDLs).\n\nDue to being issued by the government itself, these bonds are a form of sovereign debt and have low credit risk. The overall risk of a nation's bond can be assessed by looking at their sovereign credit rating which is an assesment of the creditworthiness of a country. For example, India's credit rating as of this article is BBB- according to Fitch and Baa3 according to Moody's which is the minimum grade required for a bond to be considered \"investment grade\". Furthermore, investors see full transparency of the investment process as the RBI conducts the auction for participants to see. As such these can play a crucial role in an investor's portfolio for long term wealth creation as a low risk debt instrument.\n\n## Short Term Bonds\n\n### Treasury Bills\n\nAs mentioned in the previous section, these are short term money market instruments issued by the central government. Treasury bills (T-bills) offer short-term investment opportunities, generally up to one year and are issued by the RBI for managing short-term liquidity. Treasury bills can be issued in a physical form as a promissory note or dematerialized form. It is a promissory note with a guarantee of payment at a later date and is backed by the Govt of India and Reserve Bank of India hence assured yields and zero risk of default. Which means that these are zero coupon instruments that do not pay out any interest and instead the interest component is the difference between the price the face value and the price they are are sold at. They are available in four durations - 14 day, 91 day, 182 day and 364 day T Bills.\n\n---\nThumb rule calculations would work like this: \n* 14 days bill = 1/2 month = 1/24 year\n* 91 days bill = 3 months = 1/4 year\n* 182 days bill = 6 months = 1/2 year\n* 364 days bill = 12 months = 1 year\n\nFor example, the 91 day bill can have a face value of ₹100 and issued at ₹98. That means you can purchase it at ₹98 and when it completes 91 days, you will sell it back and get ₹100. Cost of ₹98 and payout of ₹100 with a profit of ₹2. This ₹2 is the interest over 3 months and the effective rate is about 8%.\n\n14-day and 91-day T-bills are auctioned every week on Fridays, 182-day and 364-day T-bills are auctioned every alternate week on Wednesdays.\n\nDetailed maths located below [^1]\n\n### Cash Management Bills (CMBs)\nThese are very similar in nature to treasury bills, however these are issued with maturities shorter than 91 days. Introduced in 2010, they help the government manage their cashflows. For example, RBI [recently announced the auction of a 48 day Cash Management Bill](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=49282)\n\n\n## Dated G-Secs\nThese are bonds issed by the government with fixed or floating coupon rates payable half yearly on the face value. There are a large number of bonds that fall under this category of bonds.\n\n### Fixed Coupon G-Secs\nThese are bonds where the interest rate is fixed for the entire duration of the bond and is set at the time of issue. Due to this they may have fluctuations in price on the secondary markets when there is a rise or fall of prevailing interest rates.\n\n### Floating Rate Bonds (FRB)\nThese are bonds where the interest rate is not fixed for the entire duration of the bond and is revised at fixed intervals by RBI. There come in two main types.\n\n* Floating rate bonds without a fixed spread ie they are simply issued at face value and pay out the coupon rate for the currently set period.\n* Floating rate bonds with a fixed spread. These are auctioned and sold at a discount similar to the aforementioned treasury bills, which means there's a variable component which is the coupon yield set by RBI as well as the fixed spread which is guaranteed based on the discount the bond was purchased at. An example of this type of bond is the [FRB 2033 issued by RBI.](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=50728)\n\n#### Floating Rate Savings Bond\nRetail investors also have the option to invest in Floating Rate Savings Bonds offered by RBI which are a simple way to hold government bonds for individual retail investors instead of FIIs/DIIs or HNIs. These are floating rate bonds offered by RBI. These are successors to the 7.75% Savings (Taxable) Bonds, 2018 which were fixed rate bonds issued by RBI with both cumulative as well as non cumulative options. The FRSB is however, only available in the non cumalative option and investment starts at ₹1,000 and in multiples of ₹1,000, thereof without a maximum investment limit. \nThe interest is fully taxable at slab limits and the interest rates are set to revision by RBI every six months. The main thing to note is that unlike most other bonds *these can not be traded on the secondary markets, nor can they be used as collateral for loans*. \n\n### Inflation Indexed Bonds (IIBs)\nFor some duration post the Global Financial Crisis, inflation was a major concern for most emerging markets. To alleviate this, RBI launched Inflation Indexed Bonds, these are bonds where both the principle as well as the interested rates are matched to the Whole Sale Price Index (WPI) or Consumer Price Index (CPI). On their release however, RBI had used WPI though currently the RBI has switched to using the CPI as their measure of inflation. Future issues are likely to be matched with CPI over WPI.\n\nIn recent years, much of the sheen of these are fallen with inflation levels falling much lower. The government has announced a couple of buy backs of these bonds providing investors an exit. Those familiar with the US bond markets will find this very similar to Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities or TIPS.\n\n### State Development Loans (SDLs)\nState Development Loans are securities issued by various state governments instead of the the central government. In theory based on the Basel III guidelines as well as RBI's Statutory liquidity ratio requirements, these are considered to be having zero credit risk. \nIn the markets this is contested as there is often a premium over the central government's equivalent government security. The spread depends on the credit worthiness of the states in question and can vary from state to state. Since RBI is the facilitator for the state to issue such bonds they have the power to make payments to bond holders from the central government's kitty for the respective state.\n\n### Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs)\nThese are very special types of bonds that do not function in a similar manner to the other bonds listed on this page. Instead they are pegged directly to the price of gold acting as a proxy to actually holding gold. Furthermore they offer 2.5% simple interest and capital gains for bonds held to maturity are currently zero. [For more on this read up our detailed page on holding SGBs.](https://UNDER-CONSTRUCTION)\n\n \n\n[^1]: For example, a 91 day bond with the face value of ₹100 when first issued can be sold at ₹97.2. This means the interest for holding this bond to maturity is `₹100 - ₹97.2 = ₹2.8`. Nominally, this yield would be `(2.8/ 97.2) * 100` which is 2.88% yield. We can annualize this to be around 11.55% per annum.\nTo formalize this into a formula that a bond trader may use:\n`Annualized Yield = Interest for the duration of the bond * Modifier`\nThe first part of the formula can be understood as `(Face Value - Issue Price) * 100 / Issue Price`. Which in our example ended up being 2.88%. The second part of the formula is a modifier that would convert the yield from an absolute return to an annualized one. Mathematically this would be `(365 / Duration of bond in days.)`.\nComprehensively, the annualized yield works out to be `Annualized Yield = [(100-P)/P]*[365/D]*100` where `P` is the price of issue and `D` is the duration in days.\n","dir":"/en/wiki","path":"/en/wiki/Government-Securities","extension":".md","createdAt":"2021-04-02T06:19:29.559Z","updatedAt":"2021-04-02T06:19:29.559Z","to":"/wiki/Government-Securities","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1617344435166},"$loki":18},{"slug":"are-you-a-stock-or-bond","description":"Evaluate yourself as having income like a stock or bond or somewhere mixed and then accordingly plan out your asset allocation on a personal level.","title":"Are you a Stock or Bond?","category":"wiki","position":2,"toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"One way to view human life is to see it as a process of converting human capital into wealth, both financial and real.

It implies that rupees paid or received *in the future* are different from the rupees paid or received *today.* It is easier to understand that ₹1000 in your wallet today is worth more than ₹1000 in your wallet 5 years in the future. This is because you can invest that ₹1000 in your savings account and earn interest for 5 years and get more than ₹1000 5 years later.\n\nThere are 2 types of calculations which answer 2 different questions:\n\n1. What will be the value of an investment (or a series of investments) after a certain period of time? This question asks about the *Future Value.* Basically how much will be the _Future_ value of the investment. Eg. You have ₹1000 rupees today, so the Future Value will give you the value of 1000 rupees after a certain amount of time (=future).  \n\n2. What will be the investment (or a series of investments) needed today (present) which would provide a target amount at a future date? This question asks for the *Present Value.* Eg, if I want ₹1000 after 5 years, what would be the amount (called Present Value) which I would need to put in today.\n\nTwo types of Interest Calculations:\n\n1. Simple Interest – SI = P x R x T, where P= principal, R= rate of interest and T= time in years. So, if the bank account gives you 4% (=R) and you put ₹1000 (=P) for 5 years (=T), the interest would be (1000) x (4/100) x (5) = 200. And you will get 1000 (the principal) and 200 (the interest) after 5 years = 1200.\n\n2. Compound Interest – in this each year’s interest also starts to get interest like the principal (if compounding is yearly).\n\n|Year|Principal|Rate of Interest|Interest at Year End|Total Value at Year end|\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n|1|1000|4|40|1040|\n|2|1040|4|41.6|1081.6|\n|3|1081.6|4|43.264|1124.86|\n|4|1124.86|4|44.99|1169.86|\n|5|1169.86|4|46.79|1216.65|\n\n\nDue to the effect of compounding, one would get ₹16.6576 more than what one would have got with simple interest. This looks small, but compounding has great effects over long periods of time.\n\nEg. For a period of 35 years, an 8% simple interest on ₹1000 would give you a total of ₹3,800 (1000 principal and 2800 as interest). With compounding, you would get ₹14,785 (1000 principal and 13785 as interest). A 5x difference.\n\n**Future Value of a Single Investment**\n\nFV = (Present Value of Money) x (1 + Rate of Interest) ^ (number of years).\nFor our example of 1000 kept at 4% for 5 years, the calculation would be:\nFV = (1000) x (1 + 0.04)^(5)\nOr, FV = (1000) x (1.04)(1.04)(1.04)(1.04)(1.04)\nOr, FV = 1216.\n\n**Future Value of a Constant Series of Investments**\nThe excel formula of FV is there for this calculation.\n[A decent web Link](http://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/financial/future-value-annuity-calculator.php).\n\nEg 1: if you put ₹10,000 per year @ 8% interest rate compounded yearly for 35 years, how much would you get? Ans. ₹ 18,61,021.\n\n**Present Value of a Single Amount**\nIf you want to have ₹1000 after 5 years, how much money do you need to put aside today if you can earn 4%. This is the reverse of the calculation of FV.\nPV = FV *divided by* (1 + interest rate) ^ (number of years)\nPV = 1000 / (1+0.04)^5 = 821.\nThis means that the value of ₹ 821 today is the same as ₹ 1000 after 5 years, if we can earn a 4% return on our money.\n\n**Present Value of a Series of Investments**\n\nThe excel function PV would be helpful in this.

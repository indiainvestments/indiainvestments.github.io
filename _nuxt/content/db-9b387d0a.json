Is it possible?\n- Whether one can consistently beat the market - and what it takes\n\n# Beating the market — what it means\n\nThe phrase _beating the market_ can mean different things for different people. The intuitive definition is to earn returns on a portfolio level that consistently beats the market index. However, more people allocate their equity investments in funds managed actively than passively - so it makes sense to see how your returns stack up against that of professional investors, or at-least try to understand how an individual investor has a fighting chance against institutions in the chase for every possible rupee gain.\n\n## Beating the index\n\nIt's easy to achieve average market performance, one simply needs to _buy the market_ through a low cost index or exchange trading fund - and there's nothing wrong with aiming to get what is known as market returns; between February 2000 to 2020, over a 20 year period, Nifty Total Return Index [^1] returned a compounded annualized growth rate of 14.3% per year, comfortably beating inflation.\n\nIf **efficient market hypothesis** is to be believed, stock prices reflect consensus view of all publicly available information that can have a material impact on the price action of the stock. However, that doesn't render the exercise of finding mismatches between price and intrinsic value of a stock ineffectual. Instead, it involves finding instances where the consensus view of the market is itself inaccurate, thus creating an opportunity to make money from the difference.\n\nSo, if an analytical mind is willing to invest time and effort in pursuit of such mismatches, earning profits higher than the market returns is possible, and can be a great tool to create wealth for goals.\n\n## Beating professional investors\n\nThere are several logical, financial, and regulatory obstructions that a professional investor has to face, which makes the prospects of beating them higher. Some are,\n\n- The account size of professional investors is such that any meaningful investment in a midcap or smallcap stock has an impact on its price. And so, they're constrained with a limited universe of companies to pick from.\n- Professional investors are bound by the mandate of the fund they manage, and so any investment that falls outside of this mandate is out of the question, further constraining the universe of companies to invest in.\n- Like an individual investors, the performance of a professional investor is compared to market returns. However, unlike an individual investor, a professional investor can't pragmatically afford to underperform the market for a long duration at the risk of losing their clients. To a professional investor, this is known as _benchmark risk,_ and the only way to keep up for them is to imitate an index once a reasonable alpha is generated. Once this happens, the professional investor generally tends to stop caring about additional returns, and rather focuses on averting losses that could cost them their jobs.\n- Most professional investors lean towards having a diversified portfolio as a consequence of avoiding these risks, and thus outperforming the market with such diversification is relatively improbable compared to a curated portfolio maintained by an individual investor.\n\n### Is beating the market the only goal in stock picking?\n\nIt is worth noting that the exercise of comparing an individual investor's returns against that of the market, and that of professional investors is relative in nature. However, picking stocks should encompass more than that. Critics would be correct to note that majority of individual investors beating the market luck out on taking incremental risks that they don't necessarily know or acknowledge. As Seth Klerman notes in his annotation in Howard Marks' _The Most Important Thing —_\n\n> \"Beating the market matters, but limiting risk matters just as much. Ultimately, investors have to ask themselves whether they are interested in relative or absolute returns. Losing 45 percent while the market drops 50 percent qualifies as market outperformance, but what a pyrrhic victory this would be for most of us.\"\n\nAn argument can be made that another upside to the exercise of stock picking is that if it is done correctly, the comprehension of risks associated with the equity you hold is higher than when investing in a fund — active or passive. The reason is simple: it takes less time and effort to keep track of stocks in the individual investor's concentrated portfolio than stocks in a diversified equity fund.\n\n# Can you beat the market?\n\nEstablishing the possibility of beating the market is kaput if one doesn't acknowledge what it takes to do it consistently — a brutal cocktail of time, effort, discipline, conviction, contrarianism, and an investment philosophy to invest the time, effort, discipline, and conviction in.\n\n## Sticking to an investment philosophy\n\nAn investment philosophy can be thought of as a construct of mental models upon which the investor builds his portfolio upon. If the universe of stocks under the investor's circle of competence is chaos - an unexplored territory of potential, the investor mines out order from this chaos in the form of a portfolio, using mental models as stencils. The lack of having an investment philosophy generally results in owning stocks that are not a perfect fit for the portfolio. As Chuck Palahniuk writes in his book,\n\n> 'If you don't know what you want, you end up with a lot you don't.'\n\nSo, mental models help investors validate their strategy by providing a confined framework, and an investment philosophy is a set of mental models that the investor follows. Luckily, mental models in stock picking have been figured out to a large extent (such as momentum, growth, low multiples, and value investing), one simply needs to recognize, study, and implement them.\n\n## Second level thinking — having an _'edge'_\n\nFor all intents and purposes, every investor (professional and individual) competes in pursuit of profits in any asset working with the same information available in the public forum. The consensus on the impact of this information is what establishes the stock price in the short run, and so if your view aligns with that of the majority, it makes sense that you'll largely make market returns - every investor can't beat the market as together they are the market. To get extraordinary returns, you need to have an extraordinary perspective. This is what Howard Marks calls _second level thinking_, Ben Graham calls _trace of wisdom_, and Warren Buffett & Charlie Munger calls _having an edge._\n\nThis is not to say the consensus view of information is always wrong, in all likeliness millions of other investors may be smarter and more knowledgeable than you. The idea is to find instances where the individual investor can use contrarian insight that the market isn't reflecting, and it has to be accurate, or at-least _more correct_ than the consensus view.\n\nTo quote Howard Marks' _The Most Important Thing,_\n\n> Only if your behavior is unconventional is your performance likely to be unconventional, and only if your judgments are superior is your performance likely to be above average. For your performance to diverge from the norm, your expectations— and thus your portfolio—have to diverge from the norm, and you have to be more right than the consensus. Different and better: that’s a pretty good description of second-level thinking.\n\nMarks also proceeds to provide a framework, a set of questions that an investor must ask when working with contrarian thinking,\n\n- What is the range of likely future outcomes?\n- Which outcome do I think will occur?\n- What’s the probability I’m right?\n- What does the consensus think?\n- How does my expectation differ from the consensus?\n- How does the current price for the asset comport with the consensus view of the future, and with mine?\n- Is the consensus psychology that’s incorporated in the price too bullish or bearish?\n- What will happen to the asset’s price if the consensus turns out to be right, and what if I’m right?\n\nTo sum it up, holding consensus view on any material information comes naturally to us — specially if an investor relies on financial news channels or social media to acquire information; but that's not how above average returns can be achieved, by definition consensus views largely yields market return. The ability to accurately spot market inefficiencies requires _an edge._\n\n## Reading it all\n\nTaking the time and effort to read annual reports, brokerage reports, primers, conference call transcripts, and various other filings are all part of what an investors signs up for while performing due diligence for a company. Skim, and you may miss what disproves your investment thesis, which is perhaps ond of the major reasons for higher churn rates in an individual investor's portfolio.\n\nWhen asked on how to make smart investments, Warren Buffett said,\n\n> “Read 500 pages like this every week. That’s how knowledge builds up, like compound interest.”\n\nTo beat the market, you need to bring what's needed to be a succesful investor, and that means sacrificing a lot of time and effort that could have been used elsewhere, like your day job. **At some point, an investor needs to decide whether the cost of time and effort exceeds the benefit of outperformance in his/her stock picking journey.**\n\n## Conviction and patience is everything\n\nHaving an accurate non-consensus view will only get you as far as your conviction on the investment thesis goes. Remember, the market can stay irrational for long durations of time. As Sanjay Bakshi notes in his apparance in an episode of the We Study Billionaires podcast, unlike many other professions, an investor rarely receives an immediate feedback on his operations. Sometimes it takes years for the market to catch up to intrinsic value of an asset, and so it is hard to separate luck from genuine success — so hold on to the underlying process rather than focusing on the outcome. A good handle on your conviction helps you to hang in until other investors catch up on the market's inefficiencies. On this subject, Joel Greenblatt annotates on _The Most Important Thing,_\n\n> I always tell my students, “If you do a good job valuing a stock, I guarantee that the market will agree with you.” I just don’t tell them when. It could be weeks or years.\n\nAnother thing to note is an investor should never rely on borrowed conviction, primarily because it's never enough to hold on to. If you don't do your own research, and rather rely on someone else's, the conviction tends to be weak, and so emotions act up, and exit plans are broken before the thesis fully appreciates. The other reason is that you have to rely on the goodwill of the researcher, as they may not warn you if something disproves their thesis.\n\n### Investing can't be perfectly routinized\n\nAs Howard Marks notes in _The Most Important Thing,_ investing is more art than science — in the sense that past results can't be relied upon with confidence, the cause and effect relationships can't be depended upon. And so, investing can't be routinized. An investor must be able to adapt to changes in the market dynamics to consistently outperform the market.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nTo sum it up, an individual investor needs to invest time and effort, have a capability to think on a higher level than the consensus view, adapt to changes in market dynamics, and have the capacity for patience and conviction to consistently beat the market.\n\n[^1]: In India, we don't have any index fund/ETF which gives exposure to the total stock markets.

You do NOT need demat account / trading account, to invest in mutual funds. In fact, you should strive to avoid Demat mode of holding when it comes to mutual funds.\n\nMutual funds are sold by AMC (Asset Management Companies) directly to you. RTA (Registrar and Transfer Agent) of the relevant AMC processes the transaction, and keeps records of your units purchase or selling.\n\nIt's already stored electronically, with legal ownership that it belongs to you.\n\nFor instance, if you buy units in SBI Bluechip (not a recommendation, using as an example), then SBI AMC would issue you units, and its RTA, CAMS, would be responsible for maintaining these transaction details as _source of truth_, when it comes to your holdings in the fund.\n\nIf you add Demat on top of that, it'd create an extra layer of abstraction, that adds plenty of headaches, with little to no benefits.\n\nDemat folios (folios where your units are purchased through a broker in demat mode), don't let you port these into other platforms. In non-demat mode of holding (also known as _Statement of Account_ mode, or SOA mode); your units are only with RTA, and you can purchase through one platform (INDMoney, for example), and sell those units through another platform (MFUtility, for example); while track your portfolio in a third platform (Kuvera, for example).\n\nYou aren't limited by the platform in this scenario. You can transact on your folio through any platform of your choice, track your holdings in any other platform of your choice. If a platform doesn't offer a functionality (say, instant redemption from Liquid funds, or creating new folio for tax optimizations), you can directly use the web portal of the respective AMC to place that particular transaction in your folio.\n\nIt gives you a freedom so that you're not _vendor-locked-in_ with your broker.\n\nDemat mode of holding also adds extra charges, in addition to usual charges of mutual funds like expense ratio, for each transactions. Depository fee, annual maintenance fees for your demat account, withdrawal stamp duty etc. are examples of charges you'd typically incur, should you use Demat account.\n\nThe question should be _what does Demat mode of holding MF units bring to table, that makes it worth it?_ and not the other way around.\n\nPresently, platforms like **Coin**, **HDFC Securities** etc. offer mainly Demat mode of holdings, which are best avoided if possible, especially in favor of free direct plan platforms, that you can get if you just have a savings account in a bank.\n","dir":"/en/faqs","path":"/en/faqs/demat-account-buy-units-in-mutual-funds","extension":".md","createdAt":"2021-02-06T16:31:10.785Z","updatedAt":"2021-02-06T16:31:10.785Z","to":"/faqs/demat-account-buy-units-in-mutual-funds","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1612629135667},"$loki":6},{"slug":"eli5-chit-funds","description":"Closed system, where someone's gain is another person's loss.

If you still want to take such a risk, at least go by organized reputed chit fund groups, and not local unorganized ones.\n\n#### Red Flags\n\n1. Promise of high returns: Chit funds cannot promise return rates in advance, and if any of them does it, it is better to run away. They cannot do so because no one can predict at what discount would the members bid for the prize money during the entire duration of the chit fund.\n2. Unregistered: Please don't. You will have no recourse to get any money if there is any default.\n3. Incentive to get new members: If the chit fund offers any incentive to get new/additional members, then it is outside the normal rules of the chit fund and is likely to be a Ponzi scheme. Run.\n4. Allows to stop future installments after getting the prize money. This structure is also against the basic chit fund system, and should make you think of what else? Run.\n5.

If you keep it in a savings bank account in big banks like SBI, HDFC, and ICICI, you'll get anywhere from ₹2,700 to ₹3,500. This interest income would be tax-free (since it's less than ₹10,000). A bank fixed deposit might give you anywhere from ₹4,991 to ₹5,875 and you'd have to pay taxes on it. Assuming a CAGR of 3%, a liquid fund would give you approximately ₹3,000 which is taxable but only when you redeem it.\n\nLast, but not least, there are **arbitrage funds**. These debt MFs are taxed like equity MFs so you don’t have to pay any taxes if you park your money for more than a year and your gains during redemption don’t exceed ₹1 lakh. This might sound good on paper but arbitrage funds are significantly more volatile than liquid funds and don’t offer instant redemptions either. The returns from arbitrage funds also depend on the availability of arbitrage opportunities and this has started to come into question.

This includes credit risk funds, dynamic bond funds, gilt funds, banking & PSU funds, ultra short, short, low, medium, and long duration funds, and corporate debt funds.\n- Hybrid mutual funds\n- Index funds like UTI Nifty index fund\n- Any other sort of equity mutual fund\n- Stocks\n","dir":"/en/faqs","path":"/en/faqs/park-money","extension":".md","createdAt":"2021-02-06T16:31:10.785Z","updatedAt":"2021-02-06T16:31:10.785Z","to":"/faqs/park-money","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1612629135799},"$loki":15},{"slug":"are-you-a-stock-or-bond","description":null,"title":"Are you a Stock or Bond?","category":"wiki","position":2,"toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"One way to view human life is to see it as a process of converting human capital into wealth, both financial and real.

With the free-float methodology, market capitalization is calculated by taking the equity's price and multiplying it by the number of shares readily available in the market. \n\nInstead of using the free float, the Dow Jones takes 30 stocks, adds the prices of each share in the 30 and divides them by a fixed value (that value as of 1st February is set to 0.152).\n\nDow Jones operates across the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.\n\n### S&P 500 Index\n\nThis is the big one. The S&P500 tracks the 505 common stocks (yes, 505 because someone companies like Google have multiple share classes both included) issued by 500 large cap companies across the US market. Unlike the Dow this index is built by using the free float market capitalization methodology and could be considered the flagship index for the US markets. \n\nThe S&P500 is a strongly diversified index compared to NASDAQ due to the NASDAQ having lower barriers to entry as compared to the NYSE which encourages startups and other newly minted corporates to first list on the NASDAQ over the NYSE. Since this index unlike the NASDAQ index tracks the NYSE aswell it also covers several mature companies. \n\nThe S&P500  operates across the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ and the Chicago Board Options Exchange.\n\n### NASDAQ Composite Index\n\nAs briefly touched in the last index, the NASDAQ exchange has severely lower barriers to entry. Normally, exchange will have tests and if a company can satify all requirements under a single test they qualify to list. Furthermore, even post listing the company must satisfy market cap requirements. In the case of the NYSE companies must maintain a minimum market cap of $15 million over a 30 day trading period versus the NASDAQ requirement of 750,000 public shares outstanding worth at least $1.1 million. \n\nWhat this means is that many of the smaller startups and growth based ventures flock to the NASDAQ to the listing and as of this post, most of them are tech companies. Investing in the NASDAQ can be considered a proxy for investing in high growth companies or even a bet on the tech sector.\n\nThe NASDAQ Composite Index operates across the NASDAQ.\n\n### CRSP US Total Market Index\n\nThis one is a fairly unknown index but it should not be underestimated. It tracks nearly 4,000 constituents across mega, large, small and microcaps and covers nearly 100% of the investible companies in US. It is the benchmark index for Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Admiral Shares (VTSAX), the world's largest fund by AUM standing at $1.08 Trillion as of this post. \n\nThere is some argument to be made that the overlap between the S&P500 and the CRSP US Total Market Index is very large and the allocation to non large cap stocks is very small to make a absolute difference in returns.\n\n## The Major Funds (US Domiciled)\n\n**Note**: There are two major differences  in which US funds differ from the funds in India. \n\n* Indian markets have the concept of growth funds which means that the fund is not obligated to distribute recieved from assets held by the fund. Meanwhile, a US domiciled fund is obligated to distribute at least 90% of its income to shareholders. Each dividend distribution is a taxable event for the shareholder of the fund. For more detailed reading on the difference, you can refer to [this post on bogleheads](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Comparison_of_accumulating_ETFs_and_distributing_ETFs).\n\n* Indian funds growth/accumalating funds are not forced to distribute capital gains to the share holders. This is not true in the United States. When a US fund sells a stock resulting in some capital gains then they must distribute at least 95% of the gains and resulting taxes to shareholders. This dividend distribution usually happens around November or December. As a result it is prudent to opt for a fund with a low turnover.\n\n### SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)\n\nManaged by State Street Advisors and launched on January 22, 1993, SPY was the first exchange-traded fund in the United States. The fund tracks the S&P500 Index. The fund has a  net expense ratio of 0.0945% at the time of writing. The SPY ETF is one of the most liquid ETFs traded on the US markets and at the time of this post has an average daily volume of 70,208,796.\n\nThis high volume and low spread makes it incredibly attractive for people who may wish to deal in options, despite having a higher expense ratio than its Vanguard counterpart VOO. A popular strategy among SPY holders is selling covered calls to generate some spare income over and above the fund's returns. \n\n## Cheatsheet \n\n### US Domiciled\n\n* S&P 500 - VOO, SPY\n* NASDAQ
